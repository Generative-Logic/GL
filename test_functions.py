    Generates a third text file containing unique lines from two input files.

    The output file will contain:
    - First, lines from file1 that are not present in file2.

    The output file is saved in the same directory as file1.

    Parameters:
    - file1_path (str): Path to the first input text file.
    - file2_path (str): Path to the second input text file.
    - output_filename (str): Name of the output file. Defaults to 'unique_lines_output.txt'.
